# 10_code_a_week
* Its a codechef problem * Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.  Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.  Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for 4 weeks. Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as P 1, P 2, P 3,and P 4 â€‹  , output the number of weeks in which he met his target.
